### In this episode

Hyperlocal Chicago digital collections, a Wordpress/Drupal/Omeka smackdown, multisite Wordpress as a library service, Agile(ish) project management making lives better, why we love staging servers, the woes of front-end testing (with a rant about our frenemy Selenium), and Lars von Trier.
